A few years ago, when the authors embarked on the task of redesigning a linear algebra course for engineering students, there was a lack of available review papers providing a comprehensive foundation on the topic and an explanation of the current state of knowledge for engineering students. Undeterred, the authors undertook an extensive examination of existing literature related to linear algebra and carefully examined their applicability for engineering students, to successfully redevelop the course. Subsequently, the objective of this paper is to provide a list of pedagogical methods the authors has reviewed for teaching linear algebra courses that applicable to engineering students. The ultimate intention is to assist future scholars who may find themselves in a similar position as the author, enabling them to save a significant amount of time by benefiting from the insights presented in this paper.
